## Introduction
This repo is for the paper "Semi-Supervised Online Continual Learning for 3D Object Detection in Mobile Robotics".


We use patchwork++ to remove ground points

## Run
1.Run OCL3D on KITTI tracking dataset using Pointnet features and PointPillars
./run_kitti_pillars_pointnet.sh
2.Run OCL3D on IUSL dataset using handcraft features
./run_iusl_hand.sh
